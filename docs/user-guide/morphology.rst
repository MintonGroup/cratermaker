Morphology
==========

The Morphology component is used to alter the topography of a :ref:`Surface <ug-surface>` object using a :ref:`Crater <ug-crater>` object. The available morphology models (currently only "simplemoon") determine how crater geometry and ejecta are emplaced. Like other components, a :ref:`Morphology <api-morphology>` model is generated using its :meth:`maker` method:

.. ipython:: python

    from cratermaker import Morphology
    morphology = Morphology.maker("simplemoon")
    print(morphology)

Crater Emplacement
------------------

The main purpose of a Morphology model is to emplace craters on a surface. This can now be done using the queue-aware :meth:`emplace_crater` method, which automatically handles crater preparation, overlap resolution, and surface modification.

.. ipython:: python

    from cratermaker import Surface, Crater
    surface = Surface.maker()
    crater = Crater.maker(final_diameter=25e3)
    morphology.emplace_crater(crater, surface)

Internally, a morphology model maintains a queue of craters that can be processed in parallel batches, provided they do not affect overlapping regions of the surface mesh. This allows for physically plausible yet efficient crater emplacement across geologic timescales.

Batch Emplacement
-----------------

You can enqueue multiple craters using :meth:`enqueue_crater` and process them using :meth:`process_queue`. Craters are emplaced in chronological order, with overlapping batches resolved automatically.

.. ipython:: python

    craters = [Crater.maker(final_diameter=d) for d in (5e3, 10e3, 15e3)]
    for crater in craters:
        morphology.enqueue_crater(crater)

    morphology.process_queue(surface)
