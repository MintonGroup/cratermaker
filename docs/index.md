# Cratermaker
## Simulate the evolution of a landscape dominated by impact bombardment.

Cratermaker is a modernized re-write of the older [Cratered Terrain Evolution Model](https://github.itap.purdue.edu/MintonGroup/ctem)). 
Cratermaker is a sophisticated tool designed for simulating and analyzing impact craters, primarily focusing on lunar and other planetary surfaces.  
Development of Cratermaker is still in its very early stages, and not all features of CTEM have  been implemented yet. 

## Features

- **Comprehensive Crater Simulation**: Accurate modeling of impact craters, considering factors like projectile size, impact velocity, and target material.
- **Crater Morphology Analysis**: Tools for in-depth analysis of crater dimensions, shapes, and distribution patterns.
- **Robust Production Functions**: Advanced algorithms to simulate crater production over time and across different celestial surfaces.
- **Monte Carlo Crater Size Scaling**: Projectile to crater size scaling incorporates natural variability capture in emprical models.    
- **Monte Carlo Utilities**: Robust statistical methods for populating surfaces with craters.

## Quick Start

Get started with Cratermaker:

1. **Installation**: TBD
2. **Basic Tutorials**: TBD
3. **Advanced Usage**: TBD
4. **API Reference**: Detailed API documentation for a deeper understanding of Cratermaker's capabilities.
