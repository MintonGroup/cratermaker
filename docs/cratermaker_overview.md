# Introduction to Cratermaker

## Overview

Cratermaker is a sophisticated scientific software tool designed for simulating crater impacts in astronomical contexts. Developed by David A. Minton at Purdue University, this project offers a comprehensive suite of tools for modeling and analyzing the formation and evolution of craters on planetary surfaces. This project is meant to replace CTEM, though it is not quite complete.

## Key Features


- **Comprehensive Crater Simulation**: Accurate modeling of impact craters, considering factors like projectile size, impact velocity, and target material.
- **Crater Morphology Analysis**: Tools for in-depth analysis of crater dimensions, shapes, and distribution patterns.
- **Robust Production Functions**: Advanced algorithms to simulate crater production over time and across different celestial surfaces.
- **Monte Carlo Crater Size Scaling**: Projectile to crater size scaling incorporates natural variability capture in emprical models.    
- **Monte Carlo Utilities**: Robust statistical methods for populating surfaces with craters.

## Development Status

Cratermaker is in Alpha development stage, indicating that it is in the early phases of its development cycle. It's geared towards Science/Research, particularly in the field of Astronomy and Scientific/Engineering applications.
