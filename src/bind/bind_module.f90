module bind
   !! author: David A. Minton
   !!
   !! This module defines the set of routines that connect the Cython code to the Fortran. Because Fortran derived types with
   !! allocatable arrays and type-bound procedures are not interoperable with C, you have to write a set of functions that allow
   !! you to access the Fortran structures. On the Fortran side, you can make use of the full suite of OOF features from F2003+ 
   !! e.g. classes, inheritence, polymorphism, type-bound procedures, etc., but any communication back to Python must be done 
   !! via a set of binding functions. 
   !! 
   !! The following implementation was adapted from _Modern Fortran Explained: Incorporating Fortran 2018_ by Metcalf, Reid, & 
   !! Cohen (see Fig. 19.8)

      !! author: David A. Minton

      !! This subroutine is used to convert C style strings into Fortran. This allows one to pass Python strings as arguments to 
      !! Fortran functions.
