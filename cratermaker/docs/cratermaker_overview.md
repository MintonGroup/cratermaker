# Introduction to Cratermaker

## Overview

Cratermaker is a sophisticated scientific software tool designed for simulating crater impacts in astronomical contexts. Developed by David A. Minton at Purdue University, this project offers a comprehensive suite of tools for modeling and analyzing the formation and evolution of craters on planetary surfaces. 

## Key Features

- **Extensive Simulation Capabilities**: Cratermaker enables detailed simulations of crater impacts, accounting for various factors such as target material, impact velocity, and projectile size.
- **Advanced Scientific Computing**: Integrating Python and Fortran, the software leverages the strengths of both languages for efficient computation and modeling.
- **Customizable Simulations**: Users can tailor simulations with specific parameters like target body, material, pixel resolution, and more.
- **Robust Data Handling**: Utilizes libraries like NumPy, SciPy, xarray, and others for effective data manipulation and analysis.
- **Visualization Support**: Includes tools for exporting simulation data to VTK files for advanced visualization.

## Development Status

As per the current `pyproject.toml` file, Cratermaker is in Alpha development stage, indicating that it is in the early phases of its development cycle. It's geared towards Science/Research, particularly in the field of Astronomy and Scientific/Engineering applications. The project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 or later (GPLv3+).
